Google has launched a URL Shortener API (Goo.gl) - one of the fastest and most reliable URL shortners out there. This plugin creates goo.gl short URLs for your posts, which then could be retrieved using the "Get Shortlink" button in your admin UI or the `wp_get_shortlink()` WordPress function. Goo.gl analytics also available!
